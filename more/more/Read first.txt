Resources:
I'm trying to learn how to animate svg: I plan to animate the bcg. For mobile there is no svgs: they just go one under another.

Starting Page:
Still not sure abt the image.

SynCloud:
I exported clouds and sparkles in various combinations. I was thinking to animate:
mobile: cloud 'hovering', sparkle gently hovering around, kinda like here: https://www.syncoms.co.uk/?page_id=2366&preview=true
pc: cloud NOT hovering bc it'd be too much, no? we can animate sparkles tho

Lmk what you think, 
Cheers,
B.
